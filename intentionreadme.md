Really its a dynamic interactive tool to identify relaitonships of things.  As people put words and concepts into the builder, it asks them questions to help articulate/define the relationship and intersection.

Ability to export, print, and eventually share through public streams or caching all input (with explicit user agreement).

By gathering and cataloging metadata and user input, we can start to create complex datasets that help us understand commonly associated elements, concepts that people would like to understand, even time it takes to complete it.

It's research into sensemaking, understanding collaborative sensemaking.

If I want to know something, either the data exists somewhere or I can build something to find out. Behavior is the best signal of what people actually think, do, believe. Surveys aren't.  That's part of Big Data.
